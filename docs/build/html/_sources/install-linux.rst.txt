This guide provides instructions on installing the Vector SDK for computers running with an Ubuntu Linux operating system.

.. warning:: The Vector SDK is tested and and supported on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04. Anki makes no guarantee the Vector SDK will work on other versions of Linux.  If you wish to try the Vector SDK on versions of Linux *other than* Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04, please ensure the following dependencies are installed:

  * Python 3.6.1 or later
  * pip for Python 3 (Python package installer)

Python Installation
"""""""""""""""""""

1. Type the following into your Terminal window to install Python::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3

2. Then install pip by typing in the following into the Terminal window::

    sudo apt install python3-pip

""""""""""""""""
SDK Installation
""""""""""""""""

To install the SDK, type the following into the Terminal window::

    cd vector_python_sdk_0.5.0
    python3 -m pip install .

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Vector Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To authenticate with the robot, type the following into the Terminal window::

    cd vector_python_sdk_0.5.0
    ./configure.py

You will be prompted for your robot's name, ip address and serial number. You will also be asked for your Anki login and password. Make sure to use the same account that was used to set up your Vector.

You will see "SUCCESS!" when this script successfully completes.

.. note:: Running ``configure.py`` will automatically download the Vector robot certificate to your computer and store credentials to allow you to connect to Vector. These credentials will be stored under your home directory in folder ``.anki_vector``.

.. warning:: These credentials give full access to your robot, including camera stream, audio stream and data. Do not share these credentials.
